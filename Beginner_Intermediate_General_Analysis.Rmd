```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load Required Libraries

```{r Load Libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Load the Dataset
```{r Loading Data, include=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("healthcare_dataset.csv")
```
## Data structure and summary
```{r Data Summary, echo=FALSE}
glimpse(data)
```
As we see, there are 15 columns(variables) with 10000 rows. All seems to be with the correct data types (will check later)

What is needed here:
1. Change variables names.
2. Check dates data types
3. Think about new features to extract and add for deep analysis


```{r Data Summary, echo=FALSE}
summary(data)
```


## Including Plots


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
